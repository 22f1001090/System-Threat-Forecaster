## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Goal:** Develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a system is likely to be infected with malware based on antivirus software configurations, system properties, and geographic identifiers.

This is useful for:
- Security analysts to flag high-risk systems.
- Antivirus vendors to assess protection effectiveness.
- Large-scale system monitoring.

## 🚶 Workflow Overview

### 1. 📥 Loading & Understanding Data
- Load required libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, etc.)
- Load dataset from CSV or other sources
- Features include:
  - `MachineID`, `ProductName`, `EngineVersion`, `AppVersion`, `SignatureVersion`
  - Security flags like `IsBetaUser`, `RealTimeProtectionState`, `HasTpm`
  - Geographic features: `CountryID`, `CityID`, `GeoRegionID`

### 2. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Explore dataset shape, missing values, data types
- Visualize distributions of features
- Identify:
  - Skewed numerical data
  - High-cardinality categorical variables
  - Data inconsistencies or noise

### 3. 🛠️ Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Handle missing values (drop/impute)
- Encode categorical variables (Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding)
- Scale or normalize numerical features (if required)
- Select informative features based on correlation or feature importance

### 4. ✂️ Train-Test Split
- Split data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()`
- Use stratified split if target variable is imbalanced

### 5. 🤖 Model Selection & Training
- Evaluate multiple machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost or LightGBM
- Apply cross-validation and tuning (GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV)
- Choose best-performing model based on evaluation metrics

### 6. 📈 Model Evaluation
- Generate evaluation metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1 Score
  - ROC AUC Score
- Visual tools:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC Curve
  - Feature Importance Plot
